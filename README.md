# 🎓 Training & Placement Cell Management System (GECA)

A comprehensive **full-stack web application** designed to manage placement activities at **Government College of Engineering, Aurangabad (GECA)**.  
It helps students, faculty, and administrators streamline the entire placement process — from drive creation to analytics — in one unified system.

---

## 🚀 What I Built

This project is a **role-based Training & Placement Cell Management System**, where users can choose between:
- 🎓 **Student** – View and apply for placement drives, track progress, and explore community posts.
- 👩‍🏫 **Faculty** – Monitor mentees, assist in coordination, and generate reports.
- 🧑‍💼 **Admin** – Manage placement drives, announcements, analytics, and dashboards.

Currently, the project includes **role-based dashboards** for each persona (Student, Faculty, Admin), enabling navigation and data visualization.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I built this project to:
- Understand and implement **full-stack development using Java and React**.
- Simulate a real-world **placement management system** used in engineering colleges.
- Learn how to design **modular dashboards and REST API structures** for different user roles.
- Prepare for scalable development with **authentication, analytics, and real-time updates** in future versions.

## 🧩 How I Built This

### 🔹 Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js (React + TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charts & Analytics:** Recharts
- **Design:** Monochrome dashboard theme with modular layout for each user type

### 🔹 Backend
- **Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Architecture:** RESTful APIs
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose or Spring Data MongoDB)
- **Security:** Planned implementation of JWT Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## 🧠 Next Steps (Planned)
- Implement **JWT-based login & registration** for all user roles  
- Add **real-time notifications** and community interactions  
- Integrate **placement analytics dashboard** with dynamic charts  
- Improve **admin control panel** for drive management  
- Enable **file uploads** (resumes, reports)
